As mentioned before, we'll build the course project without React Hooks for now (React Hooks are a new feature, introduced with React 16.8, I'll introduce them in-depth later).

Towards the end of the course, we'll have an entire module where we convert it to use React Hooks though (after having yet another Hooks deep-dive module of course).
