Follow the instructions explained in the problem video and try to implement a solution on your own. Compare it with my solution (video + downloadable files) thereafter.

You'll also need to transform a string into a real array and then join it back into a string again to complete task 5 of the assignment.

You can split a string into an array of its characters with the split('')  method. By passing just an empty string, it's split after every character.

You may then re-create a string from that array by using join('')  - again, joining with an empty string as a separator.
