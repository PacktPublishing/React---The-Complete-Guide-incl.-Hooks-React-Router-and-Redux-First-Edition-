Section 1, Lecture 4
In the next lecture, we'll write our first React code in Codepen, an online editor (it's only getting used in the next lecture).

Currently, there seems to be a bug if you add React as shown in the next video.

To fix it, replace the automatically added import paths (you'll see what I mean) with these:

https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.6.1/react.min.js 

https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.6.1/react-dom.min.js 

This should fix. And don't worry about the React version, the entire rest of the course uses 16+ :)
